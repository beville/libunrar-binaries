# libunrar-binaries
Binary builds of RARLab's libunrar for Unix systems

This is just a simple repository for Linux/Unix binary releases of [RARLab's unrar library](https://www.rarlab.com/rar_add.htm), since they only have a compiled version of the library for Windows.

For use with the [unrar python module](https://github.com/matiasb/python-unrar).
